You are develop the software to control the collection of the virtual musical instruments. Not long ago the 3 musical instruments have been added to your collection - Guitar, Piano and Violin. But there is one problem with them - they have been developed by another programmer so their methods are not the same which you use in all other instruments. To avoid the confusion you should to create an adapters to help new new instrumets become the part of your collection.
<br>
They use methods: play_guitar(), play_piano() and play_violin(). Your previous instruments use the method play() to do the same - play music. Create an adapters and resolve this situation.
In this mission you should use this design pattern - <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern'>Adapter</a>.<br>

You don't need to create the classes for those instruments - they are already created.

<strong>Examples</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
song_1 = Guitar("'A thousand years' by Christina Perri")
song_2 = Piano("'Nothing else matters' by Metallica")
song_3 = Violin("'Princes of the Universe' by Queen")

guitar_song = GuitarAdapter(song_1)
piano_song = PianoAdapter(song_2)
violin_song = ViolinAdapter(song_3)

guitar_song.play() == "♮𝄫♮♮♮𝄫𝄫♮𝄫♮♮♮♮𝄫𝄫♮♮♮♮♮♮♮♮♮♮𝄫♮♮𝄫♮𝄫♮♮𝄫♮♮𝄫"
piano_song.play() == "♭♭♯♭♭♯♭♭♭♯♭♭♯♭♭♯♭♭♯♭♭♭♭♭♭♭♭♯♭♯♭♭♯♭♯"
violin_song.play() == "♭♭♭~♭♭~♭♭~♭♭♭♭~♭~♭~♭~♭♭~♭♭♭♭♭♭~~~♭"
